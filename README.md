# zfmpe1

**zfmpe1 is a small but incredibly powerful discord bot that gives you amazing tools to filter and change your videos to whatever you want.**

zfmpe1 uses ffmpeg and makes it easy to use on discord. 
to render a new video, do `z run [filter]`, following the presets/commands you want to use. you can get the command list at `z all`. 
have fun!

if you want zfmpe1 on your server, contact Zelo101#0138 with the member count and a discord invite 
(i dont want zfmpe1's server to become too busy)
